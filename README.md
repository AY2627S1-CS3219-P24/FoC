# CS3219 — Software Design and Architecture (AY2627 Sem 1)

## Friend on Campus (FoC)

**Friend on Campus (FoC)** is a peer-to-peer campus errand platform where
students can request items to be collected from stores or facilities on
campus, and other students can fulfil (and deliver) those requests. The
platform runs on a closed credit economy — credits cannot be bought,
withdrawn, or exchanged for money, and only circulate within the platform.


**Live Application:** [Open FoC](https://cs3219-p24.mooo.com)

### Core Features

- **User Management:** Register with a NUS email address, verify the account,
  sign in, and manage personal profiles. Administrators can manage user
  accounts.

- **Supplier Management:** Browse campus suppliers, including their pickup
  information, categories, and opening hours. Administrators can create
  and update supplier listings.

- **Errand Management:** Create errand requests, accept courier work,
  record pickup, and confirm completion. Open requests can be cancelled
  or expire. Administrators can inspect order records.

- **Credit Management:** View credit balances, reserve credits when
  creating an errand, and pay the courier upon completion. Reserved
  credits are released following cancellation or expiry.

## Repository Structure

The four core services are independent Spring Boot modules in a Gradle
multi-project repository. Each service owns its source code, configuration,
database migrations, and tests.

```


Services communicate through HTTP and asynchronous SNS/SQS events.
Local development uses Floci to emulate the required AWS services.

## Getting Started

Run the following commands from the repository root unless stated otherwise.


### Run in Containers

**Prerequisites:** Docker with Docker Compose and OpenSSL.

Follow the [container setup guide](docs/containers.md#setup) to:

1. Create `.env.prod` from `.env.prod.example` and configure the required values.
2. Generate the JWT signing and verification keys.
3. Configure email delivery and the initial administrator account.

After completing those steps, build the application, initialize its data,
and start the stack:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.prod -f compose.prod-local.yaml build

docker compose --env-file .env.prod -f compose.prod-local.yaml --profile setup run --rm admin-init

docker compose --env-file .env.prod -f compose.prod-local.yaml --profile setup run --rm supplier-seed

docker compose --env-file .env.prod -f compose.prod-local.yaml up -d
```

Open [https://localhost](https://localhost). The default local TLS
certificate is self-signed, so the browser displays a certificate warning.

This configuration runs the application in containers with PostgreSQL and
Floci. The setup tasks create a verified administrator and populate supplier
data.

See the [container guide](docs/containers.md) for configuration details,
later deployments, logs, and shutdown instructions.


### Local Development

**Prerequisites:** JDK 25, Node.js 22.12 or newer, npm, Docker with Docker
Compose, and OpenSSL. Shared IntelliJ IDEA run configurations are provided.

Follow [Local Development Setup](SETUP.md) to configure the environment,
JWT keys, email delivery, local infrastructure, and service run configurations.

Install the realtime service dependencies as described in its
[README](realtime-service/README.md), then launch the services using the
**Start all microservices** run configuration.

Start the frontend in another terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

For first-time setup, follow the
[administrator setup instructions](user-service/README.md#local-admin-setup)
and [supplier data instructions](supplier-service/README.md#local-supplier-data).


### AWS Deployment

See the [AWS deployment guide](infra/terraform/README.md) for infrastructure
provisioning, application deployment, and operational procedures.

## AI Use Summary


### Tools and Scope of Assistance

AI tools were used across the project to assist with implementation,
debugging, refactoring, testing, and documentation after the team had
defined the requirements and architecture.

| Tool | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| OpenAI Codex (GPT models) | Implementation assistance, debugging, refactoring, test-related assistance, documentation, and pull request review |
| GitHub Copilot | Assisted review of pull requests and code changes |

### Human Review

Team members performed cross-reviews of pull requests to check alignment
with the team's requirements and architectural design.

Human reviewers assessed architectural complexity, considered opportunities
for simplification, and evaluated whether implementations could be clearer
and more direct. Architectural evaluation and decisions remained the
responsibility of the team.


### Prompts and Key Exchanges

See the [AI usage log](ai/usage-log.md) for prompts, key responses,
affected files, and review records.
