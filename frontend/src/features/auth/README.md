# Authentication

This feature connects registration and login to User Service, restores login
after a page reload, guards application routes, and handles authenticated
business requests and logout. Registration opens the email verification page;
verified users can log in to `/app`.

Signed-in users can request a new NUS email address from **Edit Profile → Update
Email**. The current address remains unchanged until the new one is verified;
existing sessions stay signed in.

[App.tsx](../../App.tsx) places the Router inside AuthProvider and passes its
operations through Router context. [routes.tsx](../../routes.tsx) calls those
operations from `beforeLoad`; it does not call React hooks. Confirmed request
authentication failure causes the React bridge to invalidate the Router, so the
same guard decides whether to redirect. Axios never navigates directly.

Provider installs the interceptors and removes them on unmount. It does not keep
a second `isLoggedIn` or token copy, and it does not start recovery on mount.

## What the API functions do

| Function                                           | Request                                            | Caller uses the result to                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [registerUser](api/registerUser.api.ts)            | `POST /auth/register` with name, email, password   | Open `/verify-email` with the submitted address.                        |
| [verifyEmail](api/emailVerification.api.ts)        | `POST /auth/email-verification/confirm` with token | Show confirmation and a login link.                                     |
| [resendVerification](api/emailVerification.api.ts) | `POST /auth/email-verification/resend` with email  | Ask the user to check their inbox and spam folder.                      |
| [requestEmailChange](api/userProfile.api.ts)       | `POST /users/me/email-change` with email           | Show sending feedback and allow resending in Edit Profile.              |
| [confirmEmailChange](api/emailVerification.api.ts) | `POST /auth/email-change/confirm` with token       | Show Email updated and return to the profile.                           |
| [loginUser](api/loginUser.api.ts)                  | `POST /auth/login` with email, password            | Pass the access token to Provider's `completeLogin` and open `/app`.    |
| [refreshSession](api/refreshSession.api.ts)        | `POST /auth/refresh`; browser supplies the cookie  | Obtain a replacement access token through the shared refresh operation. |
| [logoutUser](api/logoutUser.api.ts)                | `POST /auth/logout`; browser supplies the cookie   | Finish the logout attempt and return to login.                          |

Paths in this table are relative to `/api`. `requestEmailChange` uses the
authenticated Axios client; the auth requests use `authRequest`, which adds the prefix.
Auth APIs use fetch and bypass Axios interceptors. The backend's `expiresAt`
remains part of the response contract, but the frontend does not proactively
check it. The browser processes the HttpOnly refresh cookie; JavaScript does
not read or delete its value.

## How the pieces work together

### Registration and login

```text
Form → Page → useLogin/useRegister → fetch API → User Service
                         ↓ success
Register: open /verify-email → open emailed link → automatic verification → log in
Login: completeLogin(accessToken) → open /app
```

Names and emails are trimmed, emails are lowercased, and passwords remain
unchanged. Registration excludes `confirmPassword` from its request.
Existing pending states and submission locks prevent duplicate form submissions.

`VerifyEmailPage` uses the existing `AuthLayout` for check-email, verified, and
unavailable-link feedback. `useEmailVerification` submits a link token once on
arrival, including during React StrictMode effect replay. An unavailable link
lets the user enter their email and resend on the same page. A temporary request
failure offers a retry in that card.

Correct credentials for an unverified account return **403** without either
login token. Login shows verification feedback and a link to the same resend
page. Resending too soon returns **429** with a short inline message; there is
no countdown. Ordinary profile saves do not send or change the email address.

### Updating an email address

The email form in `EditProfilePage` submits independently of the profile and password forms. Sending
and resending use the same authenticated endpoint, with the existing 60-second
interval. The target address is stored in an `EMAIL_CHANGE` token, not on the user
record. The emailed link opens `/verify-email?purpose=email-change&token=...`.
Confirmation updates the address and consumes the token in one transaction.

The verification page reuses the auth layout and background. Success offers
**Back to profile**; an unavailable link returns to **Edit Profile** to send again.
Confirmation invalidates the current tab's profile cache. Other tabs retain the
existing 60-second cache/focus behavior; a browser reload reads the new address.
No access token or refresh session is revoked by an email change.

To check the flow manually, request an unused NUS address you can access, confirm
that the old address remains visible before verification, and open the emailed
link. Return to the profile and check the new address without signing out. On the
next login, use the new address. Also check resending and an occupied address.

### Session recovery

```text
/ → /app → beforeLoad → auth.ensureAuthenticated()
                         ├── token present → allow access
                         ├── authentication explicitly ended → login
                         └── shared refresh → allow access, login, or error
```

A full reload clears the in-memory token and allows initial Cookie recovery.
A refresh 401 ends authentication in this page instance; network and service
errors remain retryable. The route waits before rendering protected content.
Loading appears after 500ms; Try again calls `router.invalidate()`.

After logout or confirmed authentication failure, the Provider prevents automatic
recovery in the same page instance until login succeeds. This is separate from
whether the token exists: an empty store on a fresh page still permits recovery.

### Business requests

Business API functions use the shared `axiosClient` with relative API paths.
The request interceptor attaches an existing token without checking expiry or
refreshing first. After the first 401 it reuses a newer token, or joins one shared
refresh, then retries once. A refresh 401 or a second 401 for the current token
reports authentication failure to Provider. Network/service errors propagate
without forcing login; non-401 business errors do not trigger refresh.

The request marker contains only the token used and whether the request was
retried. A late second 401 does not clear a newer token. Successful business
responses are returned normally, without a global session-version check.

### Logout

```text
Log out → Provider.logout()
        → capture current refresh, invalidate its result, clear token
        → wait for that refresh to settle
        → call logout API
        → page navigates to /login after success, failure, or timeout
```

The page and button stay unchanged while logout runs. Repeated clicks share the
Provider's pending logout operation. No new automatic refresh starts during
logout, and obsolete refresh results cannot restore the memory token.
Waiting for the current refresh orders normal cookie rotation before logout.

Refresh has a 15-second timeout and logout has a 10-second timeout. These bound
client waiting, not server processing. If server logout cannot be confirmed,
a later full reload may restore login from a still-valid cookie.

## Adding a protected page or API

- Add protected routes under the existing protected parent in `routes.tsx`.
- Use the shared Axios client for business APIs; pages need not add Bearer
  headers or implement their own refresh.
- Use `useAuth().logout()` from a signed-in control, then navigate after it
  resolves. Keep the control mounted until the operation finishes.
- See [Authentication Flow](auth-flow.md) for diagrams of the same operations.

## Verification

Tests check input validation, form interactions, page submissions, session
coordination, authenticated request retries, route recovery, and logout navigation.
The simple auth API functions do not have separate unit tests; page and session
tests mock these functions. Two focused `authRequest` tests check HTTP error
handling and timeout cancellation. Verify actual HTTP requests in the browser
checks below.

Run from the `frontend` directory:

```sh
npm run test:run
npm exec --no -- tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
npm run build
```

### Manual browser checks

Start the required backend infrastructure and User Service with the local dev
profile. From the `frontend` directory, start the frontend:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. Use this hostname consistently rather than switching
between `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`. Open DevTools and use **Network** to inspect
requests and **Application → Cookies** to inspect the refresh cookie. Enable
**Preserve log** in Network if you want to keep requests visible after navigation.

1. **Form validation and navigation**
   - Follow the links between `/login` and `/register`.
   - Submit empty forms and check that field errors appear. Correct the inputs
     and confirm the errors update without automatically submitting the form.
   - On registration, change either password field and check that the confirmation
     error updates. Check that whitespace-only passwords are rejected.
2. **Registration**
   - Configure the SMTP environment variables listed in the root `.env.example`
     in the User Service run configuration.
     Register with an unused NUS address you can access. Expect
     `POST /api/auth/register` to return **201**, followed by `/verify-email`
     showing the address and inbox/spam reminder.
   - Before opening the email, try logging in with the correct password. Expect
     **403**, no refresh cookie, and a resend link.
   - Open the email link. Expect an automatic confirmation request, **204**, and
     `Email verified`. Follow **Log in** and confirm normal login succeeds.
   - With another unverified account, wait one minute and resend. The newest link
     should work; the replaced or already-used link should show `Link unavailable`.
     That card should accept an email and request a new link without leaving the page.
   - A resend within one minute should show the inline wait message.
   - Try registering the same email again. Expect duplicate-email feedback and
     no navigation away from registration.
   - With a different unused email, stop User Service and submit. Check that an
     error appears and the form becomes usable again. Restart the service and
     retry without refreshing the page; registration should succeed.
3. **Login**
   - Submit an incorrect password for an existing account. Expect **401** and
     `Incorrect email or password.` on the page.
   - Correct the password and submit again. Expect **200** and navigation to
     `/app`. Check that the backend has set an HttpOnly refresh cookie.
   - While a submission is pending, verify that inputs and the submit button
     are disabled and repeated clicks do not create additional requests.
4. **Session recovery and access control**
   - While signed in, reload `/app`. Expect a successful `/auth/refresh` request
     and the signed-in page to reappear. Check that the refresh cookie is updated.
   - Open `/`; it should lead to `/app` and run the session check.
   - Fast recovery should not flash a loading message. With Network throttling,
     a check taking longer than 500ms should show `Loading…`; protected content
     should appear only after recovery succeeds.
   - Stop User Service and reload `/app`. Protected content should stay hidden
     while recovery fails. Restart the service and click **Try again**; the
     session check should run again and the page should recover.
   - In a private browser window without a refresh cookie, open `/app`. Expect
     navigation to `/login` rather than access to the signed-in page.
5. **Logout**
   - Click **Log out**. The page and button should remain unchanged while the
     request runs. Repeated clicks must not produce duplicate logout requests.
   - After a successful `/auth/logout` response, expect `/login` and removal of
     the refresh cookie. Opening `/app` again should return to login.
   - Log in again, stop User Service or switch offline, and attempt logout.
     After failure or timeout, expect `/login` without a logout error or retry UI.
   - Restore the connection and verify that logging in again works. If failed
     logout left a valid cookie, reloading the website may restore the earlier
     session; logging out again should clear it when the service is available.

### Responsive layout checks

Use the DevTools device toolbar in **Responsive** mode and enter these viewport
widths and heights. Check login, registration, all email verification states, field/server errors, session
recovery feedback, and the application logout button.

| Viewport       | Check                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **320 × 568**  | No horizontal overflow. Registration can scroll to the submit button and login link. All error messages and retry controls remain accessible. |
| **390 × 844**  | Background cropping and card spacing look reasonable. Labels, messages, and buttons are fully visible.                                        |
| **1440 × 900** | The authentication background covers the viewport, the card is centered with a reasonable width, and feedback screens remain readable.        |

Frontend tests use mocked requests. These manual checks verify real browser
cookie creation, rotation, and removal. Bearer-token requests to a real protected
business endpoint still need integration testing when such an endpoint is available.
